                                Graphics</h1>

                                rendering</p>
                            <br />
                            <p><i>Ray-tracing </i> is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall
                                into an observer's eyes are
                                retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to reconstruct exactly what the view
                                would have been. This is a
                                daunting process, because when encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the
                                ray tracing must chase the
                                many possible backwards paths of such scattering. Professor de Alfaro recently claimed
                                to have invented a new, far
                                more efficient algorithm, one that works in microseconds regardless of the dimension or
                                complexity of the scene.
                                "There are a few restrictions," he added, "and for the moment our new technique is
                                applicable only to closed
                                environments in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across any closed
                                surface." The contribution is
