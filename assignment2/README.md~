# Homework 2: Generate a Table

Copy assignment2/apps/birds from this repo into your personal repo.

Your goal is to modify two files, controllers.py and index.html, so that the content of the file data/table.json is displayed as a table at the URL /application_name/index ; the table should look like this:


Important:
When the file data/table.json is changed, the table displayed at  /application_name/index should change, without need for restarting py4web; that is, the json file should be read inside the controller code.
It is especially important that you do not hard-code the file name in the application; otherwise if the name of the application changes (as it happens in grading) the file cannot be found.  You can obtain the name of the json file in the application code via:
from .settings import APP_FOLDER
import os
JSON_FILE = os.path.join(APP_FOLDER, "data", "table.json")
